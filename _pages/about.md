I was born in Sri Lanka and completed my secondary education at Kingswood College, Kandy. I achieved  20<sup>th</sup> place in the Kandy district and 126<sup>th</sup> in Sri Lanka out of 30,000 candidates in the GCE Advanced Level examination, the university entrance examination in Sri Lanka. During this time, I actively participated in extracurricular activities such as the Astronomical Society and basketball.

At the University of Peradeniya, I was honored with the <b>Best Performance in General Programme of Engineering (2015)</b> award, presented to the student with the highest GPA in the batch at the end of the first year. Motivated by my passion for automobiles and design, I chose to specialize in Mechanical Engineering, graduating with a First Class Honors degree and an exceptional GPA of 3.9/4.0.

In addition to my academic success, I represented my university in competitive sports, playing for both the basketball and rugby teams, for which I was awarded University Colours. These experiences helped me develop valuable skills in teamwork and leadership.

Currently, I am a Lecturer in Engineering at Weston College, where I teach up to 3rd-year Higher Education engineering apprentices. Furthermore, I have participated in workshops for school children in rural areas, inspired by a strong desire to give back to the community that has supported my journey.


In my leisure time, I enjoy being outdoors and hiking with friends. I also like watching documentaries and playing video games to relax.
